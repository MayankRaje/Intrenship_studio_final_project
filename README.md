# 🛍️ Internship Studio Final Project – FlipMART

Static Front-End E-Commerce Website

FlipMART is a responsive, static e-commerce website developed as part of my final internship project. The platform simulates the user interface of a real-world online store, incorporating essential features such as:

Product listing pages with structured layouts

Home, category, and product detail sections

Add-to-cart UI mockups (non-functional)

Navigation bar, banners, and footer components

The site is optimized for desktop and laptop resolutions, offering a clean and intuitive layout that emphasizes design consistency, visual hierarchy, and basic web accessibility.

🎨 Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (static)
🔑 Focus Areas: Responsive Web Design · Layout Design · UI Structuring · Semantic HTML · CSS Styling
